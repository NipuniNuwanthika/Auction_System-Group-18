# Auction_System-Group 18

An online auction system is a web application which will help users to buy or sell items in one platform. 
Sellers can post their products for auction and bidders can register and bid for any available product.
When it comes to the functions of the system, first users have to create an account in the system in order to bid or sell a product. 
Seller is able to create listings and allow the product for bidding. Buyer can search products and place bids.  
If buyer wins the product, he will receive a message. 
The main benefit of an online auction system is convenience. As a bidder, anyone can make offers no matter their location. 
Further, bidders can place offers at all hours of the day. 
As the price increases from bids, bidders will be able to see and adjust their own bids, if interested. 
Users are able to save both time and money by using this system. 
Users have countless choices, and they can more easily pinpoint what they are looking for.
